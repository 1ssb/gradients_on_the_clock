## Project Requirements and Constraints

### Design a 3D structure which can harbour the microcontroller, display, input-output lines, FPGA board and then print/make it.
### Precision/Accuracy: Determine the numerical precision needed for your computations. This affects the FPGA design, especially the choice between fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic.
### Power Consumption: Identify your power budget. This could influence the choice of FPGA and microcontroller, as well as the design of your algorithms to be power efficient.
### Wall Clock Time: Establish performance goals. Knowing your target speeds can help in designing the system architecture and parallelization strategy.
### Scalability: Plan for future expansion. Consider how the system might need to scale up in terms of complexity or processing power.
